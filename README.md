minicss
=========

This is a basic theme built with [mini.css](https://minicss.org) ver.3.0.0 - minimal, 
responsive, style-agnostic CSS framework.

Features
--------

- select one from a few pre-built color schemes (or "flavors") available out of the box;
- ability to make your site's header and / or footer sticky;
- select which one of menus will be used as main site navigation;
- enable and disable theme debugging without need to use "Devel" module.

All features described above can be set on the theme settings page.

This theme can be used as "starter" theme for your own sub-theme 
and present only minimally themed two layouts used in default Backdrop setup: 
"Boxton" for home page and "Moscone Flipped" for internal pages, so it may be 
extended for another layouts by adding your own new templates as need.

File `css/custom.css` is intended for your styles tuning without subtheming - you can edit this 
file as you need, but remember to backup this file in case of theme upgrade.
